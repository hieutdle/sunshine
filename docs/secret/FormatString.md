Okay, I need to modify the visitString method in the LoxBytecodeCompiler to support format strings like "hello ${3 + 4}". Let me think about how the current code works. The existing visitString method handles regular strings by stripping the quotes and creating a TruffleString. But now, when there's a ${...} inside the string, I need to parse the expression inside the curly braces, evaluate it, and then concatenate the result with the surrounding string parts.

First, I should detect if the string contains any ${...} interpolations. If it doesn't, the existing code can be used. If it does, I need to split the string into parts: the static text parts and the expressions. For example, "hello ${3+4} world" would split into "hello ", the expression 3+4, and " world".

The challenge is to parse the expressions inside the interpolations and generate bytecode that builds the final string by concatenating all the parts. Each static string part and each evaluated expression's result (converted to a string) should be concatenated in order.

So, the steps are:

1. Split the string literal into a sequence of static strings and expressions.

2. For each part, if it's a static string, load it as a constant.

3. If it's an expression, visit the parsed expression to generate bytecode that evaluates it.

4. Convert each evaluated expression to a string (maybe using a toString method or some built-in function).

5. Concatenate all the parts together.

But how do I split the string? The string context's text is the entire string literal, including the quotes. For example, the input is something like "hello ${3+4}", so the getText() would return the whole thing with the starting and ending quotes. I need to process the content inside the quotes.

First, I'll remove the surrounding quotes. Then, scan the content for ${...} patterns. Each time I find ${, I take the preceding text as a static part, then parse the expression until }, and repeat until the end of the string.

But how do I handle nested ${}? According to Lox's specs, probably not allowed, but maybe the parser already handles that. Wait, in the original Lox, string interpolation allows any expression inside ${}, including nested strings. But the lexer needs to correctly tokenize the contents. However, the current LoxLexer might not support this, but assuming that the grammar has been modified to support interpolations.

Wait, the user is asking to modify the visitString method, but maybe the lexer and parser have already been updated to handle interpolated strings as a StringContext with children for each part (static string and embedded expressions). Alternatively, maybe the StringContext is structured such that when there's an interpolation, the string is split into multiple parts in the parse tree.

Wait, the current code's visitString method is handling a StringContext. So, maybe in the grammar, a string can have interpolations, which would be represented as child nodes in the StringContext. But in the existing code, the StringContext's getText() is used, which would include the quotes and the interpolations as part of the text. But that's not right. Probably, the grammar needs to be adjusted to parse interpolated strings into a structure where the static parts and expressions are separate.

Wait, the user hasn't provided the grammar (Lox.g4), but in the existing code, the visitString method is handling the entire string as a single token. So perhaps the current grammar does not support interpolated strings, and we need to modify the parser to recognize interpolations.

But given that the user is asking to modify visitString, maybe they have already updated the grammar so that the StringContext now has children for the parts. Alternatively, perhaps the StringContext's text is the entire string without quotes, and we need to process it.

Alternatively, maybe the StringContext now has a list of elements: either string fragments or expressions. For example, the grammar rule for string might be something like:

string : '"' ( interpolatedPart | STRING_FRAGMENT )\* '"' ;

interpolatedPart : '${' expression '}' ;

But if that's the case, then in the visitor, the StringContext would have children that are either TerminalNodes (for the string fragments) or InterpolatedPartContext nodes (which contain an expression).

In that case, the visitString method would need to iterate over these children, and for each, either emit the string fragment or visit the embedded expression and then convert it to a string.

But according to the current code, the visitString method is using ctx.getText().substring(1, ctx.getText().length() -1) to get the content inside the quotes. But if the string has interpolations, the getText() would include the ${...} parts as part of the string. However, the actual parse tree would have structured elements.

Wait, perhaps the original code's Lox grammar does not support interpolated strings, so the StringContext is just a simple string. Therefore, to add interpolation support, the first step is to modify the lexer and parser to recognize interpolated strings. Then, the StringContext in the parse tree would have child nodes for each part (static text and expressions). Then, the visitString method can process each part accordingly.

But the user's instruction is to modify the visitString method. So perhaps they have already adjusted the grammar so that the StringContext now contains those parts, and the visitString method needs to handle them.

Alternatively, perhaps the StringContext in the current code is still a single token, but the user wants to handle interpolation by manually parsing the string content. That would be more complicated, but let's proceed.

Assuming that the StringContext is structured with the parts, the visitString method would iterate through each part. For example, the string "hello ${3+4}" would have a static part "hello ", followed by an expression part 3+4.

In that case, in the visitString method, instead of handling the entire string as a single TruffleString, we would generate code to concatenate all the parts. Each static string part is loaded as a constant, each expression is evaluated and converted to a string, and then all parts are concatenated.

So the approach would be:

1. Split the string into parts (text and expressions).

2. For each part:

a. If text: load the string as a constant.

b. If expression: visit the expression, then call a method to convert it to a string.

3. Concatenate all parts using the addition operator (since in Lox, + is used for string concatenation).

Wait, but in Lox, string interpolation is part of the language syntax, and the generated code should automatically handle converting expressions to strings and concatenating them. So each interpolated expression's result is converted to a string, then concatenated with the surrounding literals.

In the bytecode compiler, each time we process an interpolated string, we need to generate code that builds the final string by concatenating all the parts. For example, "a${b}c" would be equivalent to "a" + b.toString() + "c".

So, in the visitString method, if there are interpolations, we need to generate bytecode that does the concatenation. The code would start with an empty string, then for each part, concatenate it.

Alternatively, for each part, generate code to load the part (either as a string or evaluate the expression and convert to string), then perform concatenation.

So for each interpolated string:

- Initialize the result as an empty string.

- For each part:

- If it's a string fragment: load the string, then concatenate to the result.

- If it's an expression: evaluate the expression, convert to string, then concatenate.

But in the bytecode, how is string concatenation handled? Looking at the existing code, the visitTerm method handles the + operator by emitting LoxAdd operations. So, concatenation is handled via the addition operator. Therefore, for each part, we can generate code to add it to the current result.

But the initial value would be an empty string. Wait, but in the example "hello ${3 +4}", the first part is "hello ", then the expression 3+4 (which is 7), then the next part is empty (if the example was "hello ${3+4} world", then after 7 comes " world"). So the generated code would need to:

- Load "hello "

- Convert 7 to a string (assuming 7 is a number, we need to call its toString)

- Concatenate "hello " and "7"

- Then concatenate with " world" if present.

But how to convert the expression result to a string? In Lox, when you use an object in a string context, it calls the object's toString method. So each evaluated expression's value must be converted to a string.

So, in the bytecode, after evaluating the expression (like 3+4), we need to call a function that converts it to a string. Then, we can concatenate it with the previous parts.

So the steps in the visitString method would be:

1. Check if the string has interpolations. If not, proceed as before.

2. If it has interpolations, split into parts.

3. For each part:

a. If it's a string fragment: emit code to load the string.

b. If it's an expression: visit the expression, then emit code to convert it to a string.

4. Concatenate all the loaded strings using the LoxAdd operations (since + is overloaded for strings).

But how to split the original string into parts? Let's assume that the StringContext now has children representing each part. For example, in the grammar, a string is a sequence of string fragments and interpolated expressions. So, in the visitor, the StringContext would have a list of children that are either TerminalNodes (for the string fragments) or ExprContexts (for the interpolated expressions).

But given that the current code's visitString method is part of the LoxBaseVisitor, and the StringContext is part of the generated parser, perhaps the StringContext has been modified to have those parts as children.

Alternatively, if the StringContext is still a single token, then we need to parse the string content manually to extract the interpolations. That's more complicated and error-prone, but perhaps necessary.

Assuming that the StringContext now has a list of parts, like in the grammar:

string : '"' (STRING_FRAGMENT | INTERPOLATION)\* '"' ;

INTERPOLATION : '${' .\*? '}' ; // Not exactly, but using a lexer rule that captures expressions.

Wait, but how would the parser distinguish between a string fragment and an interpolation? The lexer would need to split the string into tokens for fragments and interpolations. For example:

When lexing a string, the lexer can switch to a different mode when it encounters ${, then parse the expression, then switch back.

But this requires a lexer mode. For example:

STRING_START : '"' -> pushMode(STRING_MODE);

mode STRING_MODE;

STRING_END : '"' -> popMode;

ESCAPE_SEQUENCE : '\\' [\\"nrt];

STRING_FRAGMENT : (~[\\"$] | '\\' [\\"nrt] | '$' ~[{] )+ ;

INTERPOLATION_START : '${' -> pushMode(DEFAULT_MODE);

Then, in the parser, the string rule would be:

string : STRING_START ( stringPart )\* STRING_END ;

stringPart : STRING_FRAGMENT | interpolation ;

interpolation : INTERPOLATION_START expression '}' ;

This way, the StringContext in the parser would have children that are either string fragments (TerminalNodes) or interpolations (InterpolationContext nodes).

In the visitor, when processing a StringContext, we can loop over each stringPart, and for each, either process the fragment or the interpolation.

Assuming that the StringContext is structured this way, the visitString method would need to:

- Initialize a list of parts to concatenate.

- For each part in the string:

- If it's a STRING_FRAGMENT: add the fragment's text (unescaped) as a TruffleString.

- If it's an interpolation: visit the expression inside, then generate code to convert it to a string.

Then, generate code to concatenate all these parts using the LoxAdd operations.

But how to handle the initial empty string? For example, if the first part is an interpolation, we start with the result of that interpolation converted to string. Then, each subsequent part is added via concatenation.

Wait, no. Because if the string starts with an interpolation, then the initial part is empty. For example, "${a}" is equivalent to "" + a.toString(). So the code would need to start with an empty string, then add each part.

So the process would be:

1. Emit code to load an empty string.

2. For each part in the string:

a. Emit code to load the current result (from the stack).

b. Emit code to load the next part (either fragment or interpolated expression converted to string).

c. Emit code to perform addition (string concatenation).

So for each part, the code is:

current = (current + part)

Thus, for n parts, you have n concatenation operations.

For example, for "a${b}c":

- Load empty string.

- Load "a" -> concatenate (current is "a").

- Load b, convert to string -> concatenate (current is "a" + bStr).

- Load "c" -> concatenate (current is "a" + bStr + "c").

So the code would be:

emitLoadConstant("");

emitLoadConstant("a");

beginLoxAdd(); endLoxAdd();

visit expression b, then emit convert to string, then beginLoxAdd(); endLoxAdd();

emitLoadConstant("c"); beginLoxAdd(); endLoxAdd();

But how to convert the expression to a string? In Lox, when you use a value in a string context, you need to call its toString method. So, after evaluating the expression (e.g., b), we need to call a method that converts it to a string.

So, the code for an interpolation would be:

visit the expression (e.g., 3+4), which leaves the result on the stack.

emit a call to convert to string (maybe via a LoxToString node or something similar).

Then, perform the addition with the accumulated string.

So, in the bytecode DSL, there might be an operation to convert a value to a string. If not, we need to emit code that calls the toString method on the object.

Assuming that there's a method to convert to string, perhaps by using a LoxCoerceToString node or similar.

In the existing code, when dealing with the + operator, the LoxAdd operation handles both numbers and strings. So when the operands are strings, it concatenates; when one is a string and the other is a number, it converts the number to a string and concatenates.

But for the interpolation, we need to explicitly convert the expression's result to a string, regardless of its type. So even if the accumulated string is empty, the first interpolation part must be converted to a string.

So, for each interpolated expression, after evaluating it, we need to ensure it's converted to a string. How to do that in the bytecode?

Perhaps the code should emit a call to a helper function that converts any value to its string representation. For example, emitLoxToString.

In the current code, when you do something like print 3 + 4;, the code for 3 +4 is handled by visitTerm, which emits LoxAdd. But for interpolations, after getting the value of the expression, we need to call the toString conversion.

So, modifying the visitString method:

For each interpolation part:

- Visit the expression (which generates code to evaluate it and leave the result on the stack).

- Emit code to convert the result to a string (e.g., call a method like LoxToString).

Then, concatenate that string with the accumulated result.

So, putting it all together, the visitString method would look like:

1. Check if the string has interpolations.

2. If not, process as before.

3. If yes:

a. Emit code to load an empty string.

b. For each part:

i. If it's a string fragment:

- Emit code to load the fragment.

- Emit code to concatenate (beginLoxAdd, emit the current string and fragment, endLoxAdd).

ii. If it's an interpolation:

- Visit the expression (evaluates to a value).

- Emit code to convert the value to a string (maybe via a helper function).

- Emit code to concatenate with the current result.

But how to emit the code for converting to string?

Assuming that there's a method in the bytecode DSL to convert to string, like emitConvertToString().

If not, perhaps the code can use the LoxAdd operation with an empty string to force conversion. For example, emit an empty string, then add the expression result. Since if one operand is a string, the other is converted to a string.

Wait, but in that case, for the expression part, you could generate code that does:

emitLoadConstant(""); // empty string

emit the expression value

beginLoxAdd();

endLoxAdd();

This would convert the expression value to a string by adding it to an empty string.

But that seems a bit hacky. Alternatively, there should be a dedicated node for converting to string.

But assuming that in Lox, adding a value to a string converts it to a string, then this approach could work.

So for each interpolation part:

- Generate code to evaluate the expression.

- Generate code to add it to an empty string, resulting in the string representation.

Then, concatenate this with the accumulated string.

So, the code would look like:

For an interpolation part:

visitExpression(expr); // leaves value on stack

b.emitLoadConstant(""); // push empty string

b.beginLoxAdd(); // add the value and empty string (which converts value to string)

b.endLoxAdd(); // result is the value as string

Then, concatenate this with the accumulated string.

But this approach adds two operations per interpolation: the add with empty string, then the add with the accumulated result.

Alternatively, maybe there's a more efficient way, but given time constraints, this could work.

Putting this all together, the modified visitString method would:

1. Check if the string has interpolations. This could be done by checking if the string contains "${" and "}" properly. But this is error-prone. Instead, if the StringContext has child nodes for the parts, we can iterate over them.

Assuming that the StringContext now has children of type StringPartContext, which can be either StringFragmentContext or InterpolationContext.

In the visitString method, we can loop through each child:

for each child in ctx.children:

if (child is StringFragmentContext) {

process as string fragment

} else if (child is InterpolationContext) {

process as interpolation

}

But since the original code uses ANTLR, the structure would depend on the grammar. However, the user hasn't provided the grammar, so perhaps the StringContext now contains a list of elements, which could be TerminalNodes for the string fragments or other contexts for interpolated expressions.

Alternatively, perhaps the StringContext now has a list of elements, which can be accessed via methods like ctx.stringPart().

But given that the user hasn't provided the grammar, perhaps we need to assume that the StringContext has a way to get the parts. Alternatively, perhaps the original code's StringContext is for a simple string without interpolations, and we need to modify the visitString method to handle interpolations by splitting the string manually.

But that's more complex. Let's proceed under the assumption that the grammar has been updated to support interpolations, and the StringContext has the parts available as children.

So, in the visitString method, we would:

- Check if there are any interpolations. If not, handle as before.

- If there are interpolations, process each part:

a. Start with an empty string.

b. For each part:

i. If it's a string fragment:

- Load the fragment (unescaped).

- Concatenate with the current result.

ii. If it's an interpolation:

- Visit the expression inside.

- Convert the result to a string (e.g., by adding to an empty string).

- Concatenate with the current result.

So, in code:

@Override

public Void visitString(StringContext ctx) {

List<Object> parts = new ArrayList<>();

String content = ctx.getText().substring(1, ctx.getText().length() - 1); // Remove quotes

// Split content into parts: text and expressions

// This is a simplified approach; actual parsing would need to handle escaped characters, nested braces, etc.

List<String> staticParts = new ArrayList<>();

List<LoxParser.ExpressionContext> expressions = new ArrayList<>();

// Assume that the StringContext has a list of children for each part

// For example, if the grammar was modified to parse interpolations into separate children

for (ParseTree child : ctx.children) {

if (child instanceof TerminalNode) {

// Handle string fragment

String fragment = child.getText();

// Unescape any escape sequences in the fragment

staticParts.add(unescapeString(fragment));

} else if (child instanceof LoxParser.InterpolationContext) {

LoxParser.InterpolationContext interpolation = (LoxParser.InterpolationContext) child;

expressions.add(interpolation.expression());

}

}

// Now, generate code to concatenate all parts

b.emitLoadConstant(""); // Start with empty string

int staticIndex = 0;

int exprIndex = 0;

// Iterate through the original parts (assuming the order is preserved)

for (ParseTree child : ctx.children) {

if (child instanceof TerminalNode) {

// Static part

String fragment = unescapeString(child.getText());

// Emit code to load the fragment and concatenate

TruffleString ts = TruffleString.fromJavaStringUncached(fragment, TruffleString.Encoding.UTF_8);

b.emitLoadConstant(ts);

b.beginLoxAdd();

b.endLoxAdd();

} else if (child instanceof LoxParser.InterpolationContext) {

// Expression part

LoxParser.ExpressionContext expr = ((LoxParser.InterpolationContext) child).expression();

// Visit the expression to evaluate it

visit(expr);

// Convert to string by adding to empty string

b.emitLoadConstant("");

b.beginLoxAdd();

b.endLoxAdd();

// Concatenate with current result

b.beginLoxAdd();

b.endLoxAdd();

}

}

return super.visitString(ctx);

}

But this is a simplified example. However, there are several issues here:

1. The code for handling the interpolations would generate nested LoxAdd operations. For example, each static part and expression part would be added to the current string.

2. The order of processing the parts must be correct.

Another approach is to process each part in sequence, accumulating the result:

Start with an empty string.

For each part:

a. Load the current accumulated string.

b. Load the new part (as a string).

c. Perform addition, leaving the new accumulated string on the stack.

But how to manage the stack? Each addition operation takes two operands from the stack, adds them, and pushes the result.

So for the first part (static or expression), the code would be:

current = "" + part1 → part1Str

Then current = part1Str + part2Str, etc.

So the code needs to, for each part after the first, load the current accumulated string (on the stack), load the new part, then add them.

But how to manage this in the bytecode?

Actually, each addition operation pops the two top values from the stack, adds them, and pushes the result. So, after processing each part, the accumulated string is on top of the stack.

For example:

Initial step:

emitLoadConstant("") → stack: [""]

First part (static "hello "):

emitLoadConstant("hello ") → stack: ["hello ", ""]

beginLoxAdd → pops the two, pushes "hello " (since "" + "hello " is "hello ").

Wait, no. The LoxAdd operation is commutative, but order matters. Wait, in the code for the term rule (for + operator), the left operand is visited first, then the right. For example, a + b is processed by visiting a, then visiting b, then adding. So the left operand is pushed first, then the right, then add.

So, to concatenate accumulatedString + newPart, the code should be:

emit accumulatedString (current on stack)

emit newPart

beginLoxAdd

endLoxAdd

Which leaves the concatenated string on the stack.

But initially, the stack is empty. So for the first part, we need to emit "" (empty string) as the initial value.

So the code would be:

b.emitLoadConstant(""); // stack: [""]

for each part in parts:

if part is static string:

b.emitLoadConstant(part); // stack: [part, accumulated]

b.beginLoxAdd();

b.endLoxAdd(); // stack: [accumulated + part]

else if part is expression:

visitExpression(expression); // stack: [value, accumulated]

// convert to string by adding to empty string

b.emitLoadConstant(""); // stack: ["", value, accumulated]

// swap accumulated and value? Not sure.

// Wait, stack after visiting expression: [value]

// accumulated is stored on the stack before processing the expression.

// Hmm, maybe I need to manage the stack correctly.

// Let's think step by step.

// Current stack after previous steps: [accumulated]

// Now, process an interpolation:

// 1. Visit the expression, which leaves the expression's value on the stack: stack becomes [exprValue, accumulated]

// 2. To convert exprValue to a string: we need to add it to an empty string.

// So, emit code to push "", then add exprValue and "", which would produce exprValue as a string.

// So:

b.emitLoadConstant(""); // stack: ["", exprValue, accumulated]

// But wait, after visiting the expression, the stack is [exprValue]. Then we need to add accumulated + (exprValue as string).

// So, after visiting the expression, stack is [exprValue]

// Then, to convert to string:

b.emitLoadConstant(""); // stack: ["", exprValue]

b.beginLoxAdd(); // pops "" and exprValue, adds them, pushes result (exprValue as string)

b.endLoxAdd(); // stack: [exprStr]

// Now, need to add this to accumulated.

// But the accumulated is not on the stack. Wait, no: before processing the interpolation part, the stack has the accumulated string.

// Wait, let's re-express:

The processing for each part is:

The stack before processing the part has [accumulated].

For a static part:

emitLoadConstant(staticPart) → stack: [staticPart, accumulated]

beginLoxAdd → pops staticPart and accumulated, adds them, pushes result.

endLoxAdd → stack: [new accumulated]

For an interpolation part:

visit expression → stack: [exprValue, accumulated]

Then, to convert exprValue to string:

emitLoadConstant("") → stack: ["", exprValue, accumulated]

beginLoxAdd → pops exprValue and "", adds them → stack: [exprStr, accumulated]

endLoxAdd → stack: [exprStr, accumulated]

Now, need to add accumulated + exprStr:

beginLoxAdd → pops accumulated and exprStr, adds → stack: [new accumulated]

endLoxAdd → stack: [new accumulated]

Wait, but this seems incorrect. Because after visiting the expression, the stack has [exprValue], but the accumulated is stored elsewhere.

This suggests that the approach of keeping the accumulated on the stack may not work when processing expressions that push their own values.

So perhaps a better approach is to save the accumulated string in a local variable, then for each part, load it, add the new part, and store the result back.

But the bytecode may not have local variables, or it depends on the bytecode DSL's capabilities.

Alternatively, we can use the stack to manage the accumulated string.

Let me think again.

The initial accumulated string is empty.

For each part:

The stack has [accumulated].

If it's a static part:

Push the static string → [static, accumulated]

Add → [accumulated + static]

If it's an interpolation:

Evaluate the expression → [exprValue, accumulated]

Now, need to convert exprValue to a string:

Push "" → ["", exprValue, accumulated]

Swap the top two → [exprValue, "", accumulated]

Add → [exprStr, accumulated]

Then, add accumulated and exprStr → [accumulated + exprStr]

So, to handle this, after visiting the expression, which leaves exprValue on top of the stack, we need to:

1. Save the accumulated string (which is below the exprValue on the stack).

2. Convert exprValue to a string by adding to "".

3. Then add the saved accumulated string to the converted exprStr.

But how to swap the two top stack elements?

If the bytecode DSL allows for stack manipulation like swap, but I'm not sure. If not, this could be problematic.

Alternatively, we can use temporary variables to save the accumulated string.

For example:

When processing an interpolation part:

The stack has [accumulated].

Emit a DUP instruction to duplicate the accumulated → [accumulated, accumulated].

Visit the expression → [exprValue, accumulated, accumulated].

Now, emit code to convert exprValue to a string:

Push "" → ["", exprValue, accumulated, accumulated].

Add → [exprStr, accumulated, accumulated].

Then, swap the top two → [accumulated, exprStr, accumulated].

Add → [new accumulated, accumulated].

Pop the duplicate accumulated → [new accumulated].

But this requires DUP, SWAP, and POP operations, which may or may not be available in the bytecode DSL.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the correct way is to first build an array of the parts, then generate code that adds them all together.

Another approach is to process each part and build a list of code segments, then generate code that adds them in order.

For example:

For parts [A, B, C], generate code for A + B + C.

The code would be:

emit A

emit B

beginLoxAdd()

endLoxAdd()

emit C

beginLoxAdd()

endLoxAdd()

However, this is equivalent to (A + B) + C.

So for each part after the first, generate code to add it to the accumulated result.

So the first part is emitted, then each subsequent part is added.

But how to handle interpolations where the part is an expression that needs to be converted to a string.

So, the code would be:

- Emit the first part (as a string).

For each subsequent part:

- Emit the part (string or expression converted to string).

- Add to the accumulated result.

So, for the example "hello ${3+4} world", the parts are:

"hello ", (3+4), " world".

The code would be:

emit "hello " → stack: ["hello "]

emit (3+4) → stack: [7, "hello "]

convert to string: emit "" → ["", 7, "hello "]

add → ["7", "hello "]

add → "hello 7"

emit " world" → [" world", "hello 7"]

add → "hello 7 world"

So the code would be:

emitLoadConstant("hello ")

visitTerm (3+4) → emits code to compute 7

emitLoadConstant("") → stack: ["", 7]

beginLoxAdd() → converts 7 to "7"

endLoxAdd() → stack: ["7"]

beginLoxAdd() → stack: "hello " + "7" → "hello 7"

endLoxAdd()

emitLoadConstant(" world")

beginLoxAdd() → "hello 7" + " world" → "hello 7 world"

endLoxAdd()

So this approach would work.

But the order of processing is to visit each part in order, and for each part after the first, generate the code to add it to the accumulated result.

Therefore, the visitString method would need to:

1. Split the string into parts.

2. Emit code for the first part.

3. For each subsequent part:

a. Emit code for the part (as a string).

b. Emit code to add to the accumulated result.

But for the first part, if it's an interpolation, we need to convert it to a string.

For example, if the string is "${a}bc", the parts are [a, "bc"]. The code would:

emit a → stack: [a]

convert to string → emit "" → ["", a], add → "a"

emit "bc" → stack: ["bc", "a"]

add → "a" + "bc" → "abc"

So the code for the first part (interpolation) would need to be converted to a string.

Therefore, the first part's code is:

if it's a string fragment:

emit the fragment.

if it's an interpolation:

visit the expression.

convert to string.

For subsequent parts:

emit the part as a string.

add to accumulated.

So, the algorithm is:

- Emit code for the first part as a string.

- For each remaining part:

emit code for the part as a string.

emit add.

To emit a part as a string:

if it's a string fragment:

emitLoadConstant(fragment).

if it's an interpolation:

visit the expression.

emit code to convert to string.

To convert an expression to a string:

emitLoadConstant("").

beginLoxAdd().

endLoxAdd().

So, in code:

List<Part> parts = ...; // split into parts

if (parts.isEmpty()) {

emitLoadConstant("");

return;

}

// Emit first part as string

Part firstPart = parts.get(0);

emitPartAsString(firstPart);

// Emit remaining parts

for (int i = 1; i < parts.size(); i++) {

Part part = parts.get(i);

emitPartAsString(part);

b.beginLoxAdd();

b.endLoxAdd();

}

emitPartAsString(Part part) {

if (part.isStringFragment) {

TruffleString ts = ...;

b.emitLoadConstant(ts);

} else {

visit(part.expression);

b.emitLoadConstant("");

b.beginLoxAdd();

b.endLoxAdd();

}

}

So, in the visitString method:

@Override

public Void visitString(StringContext ctx) {

List<Object> parts = parseStringParts(ctx);

if (parts.isEmpty()) {

b.emitLoadConstant("");

return null;

}

// Process first part

processPart(parts.get(0));

// Process remaining parts

for (int i = 1; i < parts.size(); i++) {

processPart(parts.get(i));

b.beginLoxAdd();

b.endLoxAdd();

}

return null;

}

private void processPart(Object part) {

if (part instanceof String) {

TruffleString ts = TruffleString.fromJavaStringUncached((String) part, TruffleString.Encoding.UTF_8);

b.emitLoadConstant(ts);

} else if (part instanceof LoxParser.ExpressionContext) {

visit((LoxParser.ExpressionContext) part);

b.emitLoadConstant("");

b.beginLoxAdd();

b.endLoxAdd();

}

}

But how to parseStringParts(ctx)? This depends on how the StringContext is structured in the parser.

Assuming that the StringContext now has a list of parts, perhaps via methods like ctx.stringPart(i), which returns either a string fragment or an interpolation.

For example, each stringPart could be a child of the StringContext. So, to split the parts:

List<Object> parts = new ArrayList<>();

for (int i = 0; i < ctx.getChildCount(); i++) {

ParseTree child = ctx.getChild(i);

if (child instanceof TerminalNode) {

String text = child.getText();

// Assuming that the terminal node is a string fragment (needs unescaping)

parts.add(unescapeStringFragment(text));

} else if (child instanceof LoxParser.InterpolationContext) {

LoxParser.InterpolationContext interpolation = (LoxParser.InterpolationContext) child;

parts.add(interpolation.expression());

}

}

Then, the parts list contains either String objects (unescaped fragments) or ExpressionContext objects.

The unescapeStringFragment function would need to handle any escape sequences in the string fragment, like converting "\n" to a newline, etc.

This is a simplified example, but assuming that the string parts are correctly split into fragments and expressions, this approach would work.

So, putting it all together, the modified visitString method would:

1. Parse the StringContext into a list of parts (string fragments and expressions).

2. Generate code to concatenate all parts using the LoxAdd operation.

3. For each interpolation part, convert the expression's result to a string by adding it to an empty string.

Therefore, the final code would look like:

@Override

public Void visitString(StringContext ctx) {

List<Object> parts = new ArrayList<>();

// Parse the StringContext into parts

for (ParseTree child : ctx.children) {

if (child instanceof TerminalNode) {

// Handle string fragment, assuming the text is the content without quotes

// Need to unescape the string fragment

String fragment = unescapeString(child.getText());

parts.add(fragment);

} else if (child instanceof LoxParser.InterpolationContext) {

LoxParser.InterpolationContext interpolation = (LoxParser.InterpolationContext) child;

parts.add(interpolation.expression());

}

}

if (parts.isEmpty()) {

b.emitLoadConstant("");

return null;

}

// Process first part

processPart(parts.get(0));

// Process remaining parts

for (int i = 1; i < parts.size(); i++) {

processPart(parts.get(i));

b.beginLoxAdd();

b.endLoxAdd();

}

return null;

}

private void processPart(Object part) {

if (part instanceof String) {

String fragment = (String) part;

TruffleString ts = TruffleString.fromJavaStringUncached(fragment, TruffleString.Encoding.UTF_8);

b.emitLoadConstant(ts);

} else if (part instanceof LoxParser.ExpressionContext) {

LoxParser.ExpressionContext expr = (LoxParser.ExpressionContext) part;

visit(expr); // generates code to evaluate the expression

// Convert to string by adding to empty string

b.emitLoadConstant("");

b.beginLoxAdd();

b.endLoxAdd();

}

}

private String unescapeString(String text) {

// Implement unescaping logic here, e.g., replace \\n with \n, etc.

// This is a simplified version

return text.replace("\\n", "\n")

.replace("\\t", "\t")

.replace("\\\"", "\"")

.replace("\\\\", "\\");

}

This code assumes that the StringContext's children are properly parsed into TerminalNodes for string fragments and InterpolationContexts for the expressions.

However, the user's original visitString method was handling a simple string by extracting the text between quotes. The modified code now has to handle interpolations, which requires the parser to split the string into parts.

Therefore, the original visitString method must be modified to iterate over the parts in the StringContext and generate the appropriate bytecode for each part.

In conclusion, the key changes are:

- Iterate over the parts of the interpolated string.

- For each part, generate code to load the static string or evaluate the expression and convert to string.

- Concatenate all parts using the LoxAdd operation.

The final visitString method will thus generate code that builds the interpolated string by concatenating all the parts.

To modify the `visitString` method to support format strings with interpolations like `"hello ${3 + 4}"`, follow these steps:

1. **Parse String Parts**: Split the string into static text fragments and interpolated expressions.
2. **Generate Code for Each Part**:
   - For static text fragments, load them as TruffleStrings.
   - For interpolated expressions, evaluate the expression and convert the result to a string.
3. **Concatenate Parts**: Use the `LoxAdd` operation to concatenate all parts into the final string.

Here's the modified code:

```java
@Override
public Void visitString(StringContext ctx) {
    List<Object> parts = new ArrayList<>();
    String stringContent = ctx.getText().substring(1, ctx.getText().length() - 1); // Remove surrounding quotes

    // Split the string content into static parts and interpolated expressions
    // This is a simplified parsing approach; actual implementation should use the parsed AST from the grammar
    int start = 0;
    while (true) {
        int interpolationStart = stringContent.indexOf("${", start);
        if (interpolationStart == -1) {
            // Add the remaining static part
            String fragment = stringContent.substring(start);
            if (!fragment.isEmpty()) {
                parts.add(unescapeString(fragment));
            }
            break;
        }

        // Add the static part before the interpolation
        String fragment = stringContent.substring(start, interpolationStart);
        if (!fragment.isEmpty()) {
            parts.add(unescapeString(fragment));
        }

        int interpolationEnd = stringContent.indexOf('}', interpolationStart + 2);
        if (interpolationEnd == -1) {
            // Unterminated interpolation, handle error if needed
            break;
        }

        // Extract the expression inside ${...}
        String expressionStr = stringContent.substring(interpolationStart + 2, interpolationEnd);
        // Parse the expression (this requires integrating with the lexer/parser)
        // For simplicity, assume the expression is parsed into an ExpressionContext
        // Here, we manually parse the expression (this part would typically be handled by the parser)
        LoxLexer lexer = new LoxLexer(CharStreams.fromString(expressionStr));
        LoxParser parser = new LoxParser(new CommonTokenStream(lexer));
        LoxParser.ExpressionContext expr = parser.expression();
        parts.add(expr);

        start = interpolationEnd + 1;
    }

    if (parts.isEmpty()) {
        b.emitLoadConstant(TruffleString.EMPTY);
        return null;
    }

    // Process the first part
    processPart(parts.get(0));

    // Process remaining parts and concatenate
    for (int i = 1; i < parts.size(); i++) {
        processPart(parts.get(i));
        b.beginLoxAdd();
        b.endLoxAdd();
    }

    return null;
}

private void processPart(Object part) {
    if (part instanceof String) {
        String fragment = (String) part;
        TruffleString ts = TruffleString.fromJavaStringUncached(fragment, TruffleString.Encoding.UTF_8);
        b.emitLoadConstant(ts);
    } else if (part instanceof LoxParser.ExpressionContext) {
        LoxParser.ExpressionContext expr = (LoxParser.ExpressionContext) part;
        visit(expr); // Generate code to evaluate the expression
        // Convert the result to a string by concatenating with an empty string
        b.emitLoadConstant(TruffleString.EMPTY);
        b.beginLoxAdd();
        b.endLoxAdd();
    }
}

private String unescapeString(String text) {
    // Implement proper unescaping for escape sequences like \n, \t, \", etc.
    return text.replace("\\n", "\n")
               .replace("\\t", "\t")
               .replace("\\\"", "\"")
               .replace("\\\\", "\\");
}
```

**Explanation**:

- **String Parsing**: The string is split into static fragments and interpolated expressions. Each interpolation `${...}` is parsed into an `ExpressionContext`.
- **Code Generation**: For each fragment, load it as a string. For each expression, evaluate it and convert the result to a string by concatenating with an empty string.
- **Concatenation**: Use the `LoxAdd` operation to concatenate all parts in sequence.

**Note**: This example assumes manual parsing of interpolated expressions. In a real implementation, ensure the ANTLR grammar is updated to correctly parse interpolated strings into structured `StringContext` elements with separate children for fragments and expressions. The actual implementation should leverage the parser-generated structure for accurate handling.
